1) Create abstract base class "Game" with 'play()' as abstract method.
From that derive following classes.
Football,Cricket,Tennis
Create a class called as "GamesDemo" (public class)
inside a main method create an array of "Game" (3 elements)
Store objects of Football,Cricket and Tennis respectively.
Now traverse the array and call that Cricket's play() method.

2) define your exception class by name "MyArithException"
(MyArithException.java)
define class "Calculator"   (Calculator.java)
In this class define a function,which will accept an int and return double of it.
e.g int caldouble(int)
This function will check an int which is passed to it
It will throw exception if 0 is passed or negative passed
in case of 0 caller of this method should get error message
"Zero not allowed" 
in case of negative caller of this method should get error message
"negative not allowed"
In case of positive value it should simply return the double value.
Now define class "MyCalcApp" (MyCalcApp.java)
In this class you accept a number from user and pass that no. to
caldouble() method which is mentioned above.


3) create a package called "course"
In this package create three classes
a) Dac    with methods  term1()  and term2()
b) PreDac with  method  cet()
c) Basic   with method  finalTest()
Now write application called  "VitaApp" in which call all the methods  of the above mentioned classes.

4) define a class called as "Item" (Item.java)
with members
String itemid;
String name;
int cost;
parameterized constructor which will accept above details at the time of creating object.
member function
void display()
which will display all the details of product
create instances of this class and call the method display.
