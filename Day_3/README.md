1)	Define 2 classes “First” and “Second” with member variables , member functions and constructors of  your choice. Now define a class “Two” in which define main function . In main function create various instances of First and Second  and call their individual member functions.
2)	Create a class with static and non-static member variables. Define static and non-static member functions. Create instance of this class and call both static and non-static member functions.
3)	Define a class “Check” in which declare member variables using  different accessibility modifiers i.e.  <default>, private ,public and protected.   Define a function “disp”  which should be public.  Define a class “CheckDemo” in which you will write “main()” function. Create an instance of  the class “Check” and  show how many  variables can be accessed directly and how many indirectly.

4)	Show the example of single level inheritance with constructor invocation.
5)	Show the example of multi-level inheritance with constructor invocation.
6)	Show the example of hierarchical inheritance with constructor invocation.
7)	Define a parent and a child class . Now explain function overriding with Example.
8)	Define a parent class with one function. Define child class with the function having same name as of parent class function, but having different argument.
Create an instance of child class and call the functions. Make sure u have followed the concept of “function overloading “ in inheritance.
9)	Define a class “Shape” with “draw()” function . Now derive  classes like “Circle”, “Polygon”,”Rectangle” etc. from “Shape” and override “draw()” function. Define a class “ShapeDemo” in which  write  main()  function. In the main function create a reference to Shape class referring to any of the sub class. Using this reference, call “draw()” and check the result.
10)	Define an interface “Vechicle” with “start()” function . Now derive  classes like “TwoWheeler”, “ThreeWheeler”,”FourWheeler” etc. from “Vehicle” and override “start()” function. Define a class “VDemo” in which  write  main()  function. In the main function create a reference to Vehicle  class referring to any of the sub class. Using this reference, call “start" method.
